# PitchPerfect

An iOS application that records audio from the user and enables playback of the audio signal after it has been processed (delay effect, reverb effect, slow down effect, speed up effect, pitch raised, and pitch lowered. 

This app is one of the projects I worked on as part of the Udacity iOS program
